Train Footboard Safety System
The Train Footboard Safety System is designed to enhance passenger safety by detecting unauthorized standing on the footboard of a moving train. This system utilizes an FSR (Force Sensitive Resistor) sensor placed on the train's footboard step to detect human presence. When a passenger stands on the footboard for a prolonged period, the system triggers a multi-stage warning mechanism. Initially, it provides an audio alert instructing the passenger to step inside. If the individual remains on the footboard, the system captures an image using a camera module and sends an email alert to the Train Ticket Examiner (TTE) or railway authorities for further action.

The hardware setup includes an Arduino microcontroller, an FSR sensor for pressure detection, a buzzer for warning alerts, and a DC motor to simulate train speed adjustments. When the system detects continuous pressure beyond a threshold duration, it first sounds a buzzer warning and then, if the passenger does not move, it reduces the train's speed as a precautionary measure. The Python-based control system continuously reads sensor data from the Arduino via a serial connection, processes the information, and executes corresponding safety actions, including audio warnings, image capture using OpenCV, and email alerts via SMTP.

This project aims to prevent accidents caused by footboard travel, particularly in crowded trains, by introducing an automated monitoring and alert system. The system can be further enhanced by integrating IoT connectivity, real-time surveillance, and image processing for better accuracy in identifying violations. The Train Footboard Safety System provides a practical and scalable solution to ensure railway safety and reduce the risk of fatal accidents.
